<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Effective Containerization:</strong> <br>
    Recognizing the optimal times and methods for containerizing elements is vital when using CSS Grid to ensure organized and efficient layouts.</li>

  <li><strong>Harmonizing Grid and Flexbox:</strong> <br>
    While CSS Grid is often convenient and easy to use, I now better understand it's limitations. I found there were times I would rather reach for Flexbox over Grid, and times where employing a combination of both would be especially effective.</li>

  <li><strong>Refining CSS Code:</strong> <br>
    Managing 400 lines of CSS in this project really shed light on the importance of concise code. I feel inspired to learn to eliminate redundancy and write more effecient CSS in future projects.</li>
</ul>
